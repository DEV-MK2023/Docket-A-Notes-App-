# Docket Notes üìù

Docket Notes is a simple notes app that I built using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript.  
The main idea was to make a clean and responsive app where you can write, manage, and search notes easily.  
Along the way, I added some extra features like login system, profile popup, weather widget, and a sidebar menu for mobile.

## Features
- User authentication (register, login, logout)
- Create, edit, pin and delete notes
- Search bar with recent search history
- Weather info widget
- Profile popup with settings
- Responsive sidebar / hamburger menu on small screens
- Theme colors for customization

## Tech Used
- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript
- LocalStorage / SessionStorage

I made this project mainly for practice and to improve my frontend skills.  
There‚Äôs still room for improvements (like adding database support, dark mode, or drag & drop for notes) which I may add later.
